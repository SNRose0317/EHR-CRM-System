## Configuration Structure

Each internal user type configuration includes:

```typescript
interface InternalUserConfig {
  // Basic terminology
  singular: string;           // "physician" | "nurse" | "receptionist"
  plural: string;             // "physicians" | "nurses" | "receptionists"
  singularCap: string;        // "Physician" | "Nurse" | "Receptionist"
  pluralCap: string;          // "Physicians" | "Nurses" | "Receptionists"
  idField: string;            // "physician_id" | "nurse_id" | "staff_id"
  
  // UI routing and navigation
  routes: {
    list: string;             // "/staff/physicians" | "/staff/nurses"
    detail: string;           // "/staff/physician" | "/staff/nurse"
    add: string;              // "/staff/add-physician" | "/staff/add-nurse"
  };
  
  // User interface labels
  labels: {
    management: string;       // "Physician Management" | "Nurse Management"
    addNew: string;           // "Add New Physician" | "Add New Nurse"
    search: string;           // "Search physicians..." | "Search nurses..."
    listTitle: string;        // "All Physicians" | "All Nurses"
    entityId: string;         // "Physician ID" | "Nurse ID"
  };
  
  // Role-specific permissions and context
  permissions?: {
    prescribe?: boolean;      // Can prescribe medications
    diagnose?: boolean;       // Can make diagnoses
    accessLevel: string;      // "full-clinical" | "administrative" | "read-only"
    dataAccess?: string[];    // What data they can access
  };
  
  // Relationships to other user types
  relationships?: {
    primaryUsers?: string;    // Who they serve (e.g., "patients", "clients")
    reportsTo?: string;       // Who they report to
    collaboratesWith?: string[]; // Who they work with
  };
  
  // Professional context
  context?: {
    department?: string;      // "clinical" | "administrative" | "technical"
    licenseRequired?: boolean; // Professional license required
    certifications?: string[]; // Required certifications
    specialties?: string[];   // Available specialties
  };
}
```

## Access Control and Permissions

Internal users have different levels of access based on their role:

### Clinical Access Levels
- **Full Clinical**: Complete access to patient/client data and clinical workflows
- **Limited Clinical**: Restricted access to specific clinical functions
- **Clinical Read-Only**: View-only access to clinical information

### Administrative Access Levels
- **Full Administrative**: Complete access to administrative functions
- **Billing/Financial**: Access to billing and financial data
- **Scheduling**: Access to appointment and resource scheduling
- **Front Desk**: Limited access for patient intake and basic functions

### Technical Access Levels
- **System Administrator**: Full system access and configuration
- **Support Staff**: Limited access for troubleshooting and support
- **Read-Only**: View-only access for reporting and analytics

## Integration with External Users

Internal users are configured to work with external users (patients/clients/contacts):

```typescript
// Example: Physician configuration
relationships: {
  primaryUsers: "patients",        // "Dr. Smith's patients"
  reportsTo: "medical director",   // "Reports to medical director"
  collaboratesWith: ["nurses", "pharmacists"] // Team collaboration
}

// Example: Account Manager configuration  
relationships: {
  primaryUsers: "clients",         // "Sarah's clients"
  reportsTo: "sales director",     // "Reports to sales director"
  collaboratesWith: ["sales reps"] // Team collaboration
}
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Healthcare Organizations
- Emphasize medical staff configurations
- Include clinical specialties and licensing
- Focus on patient care workflows
- Ensure HIPAA compliance for all roles

### Business Organizations
- Emphasize business and administrative staff
- Include sales and account management roles
- Focus on client service workflows
- Ensure data security for business information

### Hybrid Organizations
- Balance clinical and business staff configurations
- Include roles that bridge healthcare and business
- Ensure appropriate access controls for mixed data types

## Role-Based Security

Internal user configurations define security contexts:

```typescript
// High-security clinical role
permissions: {
  prescribe: true,
  diagnose: true,
  accessLevel: "full-clinical",
  dataAccess: ["clinical", "financial", "administrative"]
}

// Limited administrative role
permissions: {
  prescribe: false,
  diagnose: false,
  accessLevel: "administrative",
  dataAccess: ["scheduling", "demographics"]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Role Definition**: Clearly define roles based on actual job functions
2. **Access Control**: Follow principle of least privilege for data access
3. **Compliance**: Ensure roles meet regulatory requirements (HIPAA, etc.)
4. **Scalability**: Design roles that can grow with organization
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of role responsibilities
6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update role definitions

## Usage Examples

### Medical Practice
```typescript
// Load physician configuration
import { physicianConfig } from './medical-staff/physician';

// Use in application
const staffConfig = {
  physicians: physicianConfig,
  nurses: nurseConfig,
  receptionists: receptionistConfig
};
```

### Business Services
```typescript
// Load account manager configuration
import { accountManagerConfig } from './business-staff/account-manager';

// Use in application  
const staffConfig = {
  accountManagers: accountManagerConfig,
  salesReps: salesRepConfig,
  supportStaff: supportConfig
};
```
