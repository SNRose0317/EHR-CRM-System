## Understanding the Four Environments

Think of software development like building a house. You wouldn't make changes directly to the house people live in - you'd plan, test, and verify everything first.

### 🏠 The House Building Analogy

| Environment | House Analogy | What It's For | Who Uses It |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Local** | Your desk where you draw blueprints | Your private workspace to make changes | Just you |
| **Preview** | A small model you show to the client | Show specific changes to teammates | Your team for feedback |
| **Staging** | Full-scale model house in a warehouse | Final testing before going live | Developers & testers |
| **Production** | The actual house people live in | The real application users see | Real users |

### 🌐 Our Four Environments

```
YOU → Preview → Staging → Production
 ↓      ↓         ↓         ↓
🖥️     🔗        🧪        🌍
Local  URL       Testing   Live Site
```

#### 1. **Local Environment** (Your Computer)
- **What:** Your development setup on your computer
- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000` 
- **Purpose:** Make changes safely without affecting anyone else
- **Data:** Fake/test data only

#### 2. **Preview Environment** (Automatic for every change)
- **What:** Vercel automatically creates a unique URL for every pull request
- **URL:** `https://ehr-crm-system-xyz123.vercel.app` (unique for each change)
- **Purpose:** Share your changes with teammates before merging
- **Data:** Same test data as staging

#### 3. **Staging Environment** (Testing)
- **What:** Exact copy of production for final testing
- **URL:** `https://ehr-crm-system-staging.vercel.app`
- **Purpose:** Final checks before going live
- **Data:** Clean test data that mimics real data

#### 4. **Production Environment** (Live)
- **What:** The real application that users see
- **URL:** `https://ehr-crm-system.vercel.app`
- **Purpose:** Serve real users
- **Data:** Real user data (handle with care!)

---

## The Golden Rule: Never Break Production

**🚨 CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Never make changes directly to production. Always follow the path:

```
Local → Preview → Staging → Production
```

**Why?** If you break production, real users can't use the application. This could affect patient care in a healthcare application!

## Your First Change: A Complete Walkthrough

Let's walk through making a simple change: updating the text on a button from "Submit" to "Sign Up". This will teach you the entire workflow.

### Step 1: Start on the Right Branch

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on the develop branch
git checkout develop

# 2. Get the latest changes
git pull origin develop

# 3. Create a new branch for your change
git checkout -b feature/update-button-text
```

**🤔 Why create a branch?**
Think of the `develop` branch as the master blueprint. You don't want to draw directly on it. Instead, you make a photocopy (branch) to work on.

### Step 2: Make Your Change

1. **Find the file** (usually in `packages/platform-core/src/`)
2. **Change the text** from "Submit" to "Sign Up"
3. **Save the file**

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Start your local development server
npm run dev
```

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Navigate to the page with your button
3. Verify the text changed from "Submit" to "Sign Up"
4. Click the button to make sure it still works

**✅ Success criteria:** Button shows "Sign Up" and functions correctly

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes

```bash
# 1. See what files you changed
git status

# 2. Add your changes to the commit
git add .

# 3. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: update button text from Submit to Sign Up

- Changed button text in user registration form
- Improves clarity for new users"
```

**📝 Commit Message Format:**
- Start with `feat:` (new feature), `fix:` (bug fix), or `docs:` (documentation)
- Write a clear, short description
- Add details if needed

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/update-button-text
```

**What happens now:** GitHub receives your changes, but they're NOT live yet. They're just saved on GitHub.

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request (THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP)

1. **Go to GitHub** in your browser
2. **Navigate to the repository**
3. **Click "Compare & pull request"** (GitHub will suggest this)
4. **Fill out the Pull Request form:**

```
Title: Update button text from Submit to Sign Up

Description:
## What changed
- Updated button text in user registration form from "Submit" to "Sign Up"

## Why this change
- Improves clarity for new users
- Makes the action more explicit

## How to test
1. Go to the preview URL below
2. Navigate to the registration page
3. Verify button shows "Sign Up"
4. Test that clicking still works
```

5. **Click "Create pull request"**

### Step 7: Automatic Magic Happens ✨

Once you create the pull request, several things happen automatically:

#### 🤖 Automated Checks (CI/CD)
- **Code quality checks** run automatically
- **Tests** run to make sure you didn't break anything
- **Security scans** check for vulnerabilities

#### 🔗 Preview Deployment
- **Vercel automatically creates a preview URL** like `https://ehr-crm-system-abc123.vercel.app`
- **You get a unique URL** to share with teammates
- **This URL shows ONLY your changes**

### Step 8: Get Your Change Reviewed

1. **Share the preview URL** with your team
2. **Ask someone to review** your pull request
3. **They will check:**
   - Does the code look good?
   - Do the automated tests pass?
   - Does the preview URL work correctly?

### Step 9: Merge to Staging

Once approved, a team member will:

1. **Merge your pull request** into the `develop` branch
2. **This automatically deploys to staging:** `https://ehr-crm-system-staging.vercel.app`

**Your job now:** Test your change on staging to make sure it works in the staging environment.

### Step 10: Promote to Production

When the team is ready to release:

1. **Create a pull request** from `develop` to `main`
2. **This gets reviewed** by senior team members
3. **Once merged, it automatically deploys to production:** `https://ehr-crm-system.vercel.app`

**🎉 Success!** Your change is now live for real users!

## Understanding Pull Requests

A **Pull Request (PR)** is like submitting a homework assignment for review before it gets graded.

### 🎯 What is a Pull Request?

**Definition:** A request to merge your changes from your branch into the main codebase.

**Think of it as:** Asking permission to add your changes to the shared project.

### 🛡️ Why Pull Requests Are Essential

1. **Quality Control** - Someone reviews your code before it goes live
2. **Knowledge Sharing** - Team members learn from each other
3. **Bug Prevention** - Catch issues before they reach users
4. **Documentation** - Creates a record of what changed and why

### 🔄 The Pull Request Lifecycle

```
1. You create a PR → 2. Automated checks run → 3. Human review → 4. Merge → 5. Automatic deployment
```

#### Automated Checks Include:
- **Linting:** Checks code style (like spell-check for code)
- **Tests:** Verifies nothing is broken
- **Security:** Scans for vulnerabilities
- **Performance:** Ensures the app stays fast

#### Human Review Includes:
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean and understandable?
- **Logic:** Does the change make sense?
- **Testing:** Was it tested properly?

## Secrets Management (CRITICAL!)

**🚨 WARNING:** This is the #1 way beginners accidentally create security breaches!

### 🔐 What Are "Secrets"?

**Secrets** are sensitive information that should never be shared publicly:
- API keys (like your Supabase key)
- Passwords
- Database URLs
- Any configuration that contains sensitive data

### ❌ NEVER DO THIS:

```javascript
// WRONG! Never put secrets directly in your code
const apiKey = "sk_live_abcd1234567890";
const dbUrl = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/db";
```

### ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD:

```javascript
// CORRECT! Use environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
const dbUrl = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
```

### 🛠️ How to Handle Secrets Safely

#### 1. **Create a `.env.local` file** in your project root:

```bash
# .env.local (this file stays on your computer only)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key_here
VITE_APP_ENV=development
```

#### 2. **Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`:**

This prevents the file from being uploaded to GitHub.

```bash
# .gitignore (add this line if it's not already there)
.env.local
```

#### 3. **Use environment variables in your code:**

```javascript
// Use the environment variable (safe)
const supabaseUrl = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
```

### 🔍 How to Check if You're Safe

**Before committing, always run:**

```bash
git status
```

**Make sure you see:**
```
On branch feature/your-branch-name
Changes to be committed:
  modified:   src/components/SomeComponent.tsx

Untracked files:
  .env.local
```

**✅ Good:** `.env.local` is untracked (won't be committed)
**❌ Bad:** If you see `.env.local` under "Changes to be committed"

### 🆘 If You Accidentally Committed Secrets

1. **Stop immediately** - Don't push to GitHub
2. **Remove the secret from the file**
3. **Commit the removal:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove accidentally committed secrets"
```

4. **If you already pushed:** Contact a senior developer immediately

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake 1: Committing to the Wrong Branch

**What happens:** You accidentally commit directly to `develop` or `main`

**How to avoid:**
```bash
# Always check which branch you're on
git branch

# You should see:
* feature/your-branch-name  # ← You're here (good!)
  develop
  main
```

**If you're on the wrong branch:**
```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/your-correct-branch-name
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Testing Locally

**What happens:** You push broken code that fails on staging

**How to avoid:**
```bash
# Before committing, always:
npm run dev           # Test locally
npm run typecheck     # Check for TypeScript errors
npm run lint          # Check code style
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Large, Confusing Pull Requests

**What happens:** Your PR is too big and hard to review

**How to avoid:**
- **Make small, focused changes**
- **One feature per pull request**
- **If it touches more than 10 files, it's probably too big**

### ❌ Mistake 4: Poor Commit Messages

**Bad:**
```bash
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "changes"
```

**Good:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication to login page"
git commit -m "fix: resolve button alignment issue on mobile"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation for user endpoints"
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Reading Error Messages

**What happens:** Automated checks fail, but you don't know why

**How to fix:**
1. **Look at the failed checks** in your pull request
2. **Read the error messages** (they usually tell you exactly what's wrong)
3. **Fix the issues** and push again

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 🐛 "My local server won't start"

```bash
# Try these steps in order:
npm install          # Reinstall dependencies
npm run dev          # Try starting again
```

**If that doesn't work:**
1. Check if another server is running on port 3000
2. Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct values
3. Ask a teammate for help

### 🔍 "My changes aren't showing up"

**Check these:**
1. **Did you save the file?** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. **Is your local server running?** (`npm run dev`)
3. **Did you refresh your browser?** (F5 or Cmd+R)
4. **Are you looking at the right URL?** (`http://localhost:3000`)

### 📱 "The automated checks are failing"

1. **Look at the error message** in your pull request
2. **Common issues:**
   - **TypeScript errors:** Run `npm run typecheck` locally
   - **Linting errors:** Run `npm run lint` locally
   - **Test failures:** Run `npm run test` locally

### 🔄 "I need to update my branch with latest changes"

```bash
# From your feature branch:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout your-branch-name
git merge develop
```

### 🆘 "I think I broke something"

1. **Don't panic!** This is normal and fixable
2. **Check if it's just local:** Can other people reproduce the issue?
3. **Check staging:** Does the issue exist there too?
4. **Ask for help:** Senior developers are there to help

### 🔐 "I think I committed a secret"

1. **Stop immediately**
2. **Don't push to GitHub** if you haven't already
3. **Contact a senior developer** immediately
4. **If you already pushed:** They'll help you remove it from history
